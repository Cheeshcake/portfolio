      I'm a passionate, self-proclaimed designer who specializes in full stack
      development (React.js & Node.js). I am very enthusiastic about bringing
      the technical and visual aspects of digital products to life. User
      experience, pixel perfect design, and writing clear, readable, highly
      performant code matters to me.

      I began my journey as a web developer in 2015, and since then, I've
      continued to grow and evolve as a developer, taking on new challenges and
      learning the latest technologies along the way. Now, in my early thirties,
      7 years after starting my web development journey, I'm building
      cutting-edge web applications using modern technologies such as Next.js,
      TypeScript, Nestjs, Tailwindcss, Supabase and much more.

      When I'm not in full-on developer mode, you can find me hovering around on
      twitter or on indie hacker, witnessing the journey of early startups or
      enjoying some free time. You can follow me on Twitter where I share
      tech-related bites and build in public, or you can follow me on GitHub.
